# ColourQuant
This is the code for an article "ColourQuant: a high-throughput technique to extract and quantify colour phenotypes from plant images" in a book chapter by Mao Li*, Margaret H. Frank*, and ZoÃ« Migicovsky.

We present ColourQuant, an automated high-throughput pipeline that allows users to extract colour phenotypes from images. This pipeline includes methods for colour phenotyping using mean pixel values, Gaussian density estimator of Lab colour, and the analysis of shape-independent colour patterning by circular deformation.
